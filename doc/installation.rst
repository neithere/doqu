Installation
============

As easy as it can be::

    $ pip install pymodels

Another way is to use the Mercurial repo::

    $ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/neithere/pymodels
    $ cd pymodels
    $ ./setup.py install

You will also need to install backend-specific libraries (see :doc:`backends`).

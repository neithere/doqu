Doqu
====

`Doqu` is a lightweight schema/query framework for document databases.
It is not an ORM as it doesn't map existing schemata to Python objects but
instead defines them on a higher layer built upon a schema-less storage
(key/value or document-oriented). You define models as a valuable subset of the
whole database and work with only certain parts of existing entities â€”  the
parts that you need.

The name "doqu" is a shortcut for *document-query*, the central concept
of the library.

Installation

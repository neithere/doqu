Models is a framework for mapping Python classes to semi-structured data.
It isn't an ORM because it does not map *relational* data to Python objects.
Instead it helps to define a valuable subset of data in a key/value storage
or a document-oriented database and allows to work with only certain parts
of entities -- the parts you need.

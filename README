Docu
====

`Docu` is a lightweight schema/query framework for document databases.
It is not an ORM as it doesn't map existing schemata to Python objects but
instead defines them on a higher layer built upon a schema-less storage
(key/value or document-oriented). You define models as a valuable subset of the
whole database and work with only certain parts of existing entities â€”  the
parts that you need.

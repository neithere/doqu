    to represent data at least somehow. However, in the future some generic
    catch-all model may be introduced here.
    Another caveat is the namespace: we can easily reference an item located in
    another database but we need to keep the reference alive or proxied; anyway
    namespace should be somehow noted.

    `Reference(SomeModel)` is exactly equivalent to `Property(SomeModel)`.
    However, `Reference` provides additional features such as recursive
    relationships: `Reference('self')`.

The "Models" project was originally developed by:

  * Andrey Mikhaylenko <andy@neithere.net>

...and here is an inevitably incomplete list of contributors, i.e.
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations
and generally made Models better:

  * Timoth√©e Peignier
  * you? :)

Patches, ideas and any feedback is highly appreciated.
